# TPM Auto-Reseal Hook for initramfs updates
#
# This script is triggered AFTER any initramfs image is successfully generated.
# It temporarily downgrades the TPM policy to allow the next boot to succeed automatically,
# then sets a trigger for the post-reboot systemd service to restore full security.
#
# This script is executed with two arguments:
# $1: The kernel version (e.g., 6.8.4-3-pve)
# $2: The absolute path to the generated initramfs image

# --- Guard Clause: Ensure the script is called correctly ---
if [ -z "$1" ] || [ -z "$2" ]; then
    # Exit silently if not called with the expected arguments.
    exit 0
